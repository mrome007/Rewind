# Rewind
I wanted to make a game so I can practice the Command Design Pattern. The example that I read used it for rewind purposes, so I developed a game where you can rewind movement. The goal is get the player to its corresponding goal. Press PLAY button to start moving. The STOP button will stop players from moving. And the REWIND button will rewind the steps your player(s) has taken.
